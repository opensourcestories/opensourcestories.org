# Contributing to the Open Source Stories website

Open Source Stories encourages contributions! There are several ways to get involved, and we look forward to working with you.

## :ant: Website testing

Find a bug in the site? Did it not play friendly with certain browser configurations? Did we miss adding `alt-text` somewhere? Please file an issue (using the Bug report template) and will get to it as soon as possible.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improving / optimizing the site

If you're looking to help fix issues, have an idea of how to improve the site itself, or want to add tests, please follow these steps:

1. Find an issue that you want to fix
1. If none exist, create the issue that outlines the behavior or optimization you want to contribute
1. Fork the repository into your account
1. Make your changes
1. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository
1. Check the generated site preview and see if it behaves as expected
1. Wait for a maintainer to review and approve your change

We will follow the model of [The GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

## :art: Design & Editorial 

We would love design help! Areas where we need particular help:

* Designing a logo and illustrations
* Customizing the website's look and feel
* Probably a lot of other places

We will always need editorial help! From writing and editing blog posts to reviewing site copy, good writers are invaluable.
