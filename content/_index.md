Open source is more than what we find in a repository.

Open source is *collaboration*, *communication*, *community*, and more.

The Open Source Stories project celebrates this expanded view on what is counted and who represents open source by collecting narratives from creators, contributors, and consumers alike.

Our goal is to make the **people of open source** and their **lived experiences** more visible.
