Open Source Stories is a project created by [Amanda Casari](https://twitter.com/amcasari) and [Julia Ferraioli](https://twitter.com/juliaferraioli), intended to document the oral histories and untold narratives of open source.

## History

When Julia and Amanda were outlining the foundation of what would become [OCEAN](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/partner/OCEAN/) (Open source Complex Ecosystems And Networks), they quickly ran out of dry erase board space. Abstracting the nuances of open source hinges on making the invisible visible. There is far more unwritten than is captured in any existing data.

They began talking to people throughout the open source ecosystem to begin to identify the unrecorded areas where decisions, collaborations, contributions, and interactions took place. While they deepened their own understanding during these unstructured interviews, they also wished that these stories were captured for everyone to understand the nuances, history, and motivations which have shaped the evolution of open source.

Open Source Stories was born.

## Current state

Open Source Stories is still in its initial stages. Right now, we are reaching out to select storytellers as we smooth out the edges of the contributor experience. By the end of the year, we hope to expand storytelling slots to anyone with an open source story to share, as well as introduce a self-directed option.

Please stay tuned!

## About the founders

Amanda Casari is a developer relations engineer leading research and open data projects to better understand risk and resilience in open source ecosystems. She once co-wrote a [SuperbOwl](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/feature-engineering-for/9781491953235/) book because where you choose to shelve a feature matters. She was named an External Faculty member of the Vermont Complex Systems Center in 2021. Amanda is persistently fascinated by the difference between the systems we aim to create and the ones that emerge, and pie.

Julia Ferraioli is a technical program manager focused on the meta of open source: compliance, sustainability, tooling, and research. Her background includes research in machine learning, robotics, HCI, and accessibility. Julia finds energy in developing creative demos, creating beautiful documents, and rainbow sprinkles. Sheâ€™s a fierce supporter of LaTeX, the Oxford comma, and small pull requests.
