## Contribute a story

Open Source Stories uses [StoryCorps](https://storycorps.org/) to record and archive stories. You can listen to previously recorded stories on the [StoryCorps archive](https://archive.storycorps.org/communities/open-source-stories/). If you elect to publish a story, it will be [automatically saved](https://support.storycorps.me/hc/en-us/articles/206159477-If-I-record-an-interview-with-the-StoryCorps-App-or-StoryCorps-Connect-does-that-mean-anyone-around-the-world-can-listen-to-it-) in the StoryCorps archive at the Library of Congress.

Recording stories is done with the [StoryCorps app](https://storycorps.org/participate/storycorps-app/) for in-person interviews or with [StoryCorps Connect](https://storycorps.org/participate/storycorps-connect/) for remote interviews.

Right now, we are testing out the format with invited contributors before opening it up to a larger audience. If you would like to request to be added to the list, please email us at [interviews@opensourcestories.org](mailto:interviews@opensourcestories.org) with some background about the story you would like to tell.

### Recommended equipment

At a minimum, please be prepared with headphones and a microphone. An external microphone will yield better audio (and help with transcription), but as long as we can hear you clearly, you should be fine.

## Help with the website

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/opensourcestories/opensourcestories.org) to collaborate on our website. Please file issues, contribute to our documentation, or submit a pull request!
