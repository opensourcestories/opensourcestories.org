## <a id="contribute"></a> Contribute a story

Open Source Stories uses [StoryCorps](https://storycorps.org/) to record and archive stories. You can listen to previously recorded stories on the [StoryCorps archive](https://archive.storycorps.org/communities/open-source-stories/). If you elect to publish a story, it will be [automatically saved](https://support.storycorps.me/hc/en-us/articles/206159477-If-I-record-an-interview-with-the-StoryCorps-App-or-StoryCorps-Connect-does-that-mean-anyone-around-the-world-can-listen-to-it-) in the StoryCorps archive at the [United States Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/).

Recording stories is done with the [StoryCorps app](https://storycorps.org/participate/storycorps-app/) for in-person interviews or with [StoryCorps Connect](https://storycorps.org/participate/storycorps-connect/) for remote interviews. If you prefer to not create a StoryCorps account, please let us know and we will work with you to find an alternate method. 

At the moment, we are testing out the format with a limited number of invited contributors before opening it up to a larger audience. If you would like to request to be added to the list, please email us at [interviews@opensourcestories.org](mailto:interviews@opensourcestories.org) with some background about the story you would like to tell.

### <a id="equipment"></a> Recommended equipment

At a minimum, please be prepared with headphones and a microphone. An external microphone will yield better audio (and help with transcription), but as long as we can hear you clearly, you should be fine.

### <a id="recording-tips"></a> Recording tips

To prepare for the recording, we ask that you check your setup for use with the interview method you selected.
